# bump

Bump a given version up to the next number.

 * Handles semver, amongst others.
 * Basically, any version numbering scheme where:
   * There's a dot between each part
   * There's a number in each part
 * Handles prefixes (v1.2.3)
 * Handles 'prerelease' thingies (just bumps to the next version)
